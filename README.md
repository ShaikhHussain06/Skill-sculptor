# Skill Sculpture lite

> **Abstract** : SkillSculptor Lite is a web app where users select a topic like "Machine Learning" from a dropdown, and the app fetches related learning resources using public APIs — YouTube videos, Udemy courses, and GitHub projects — and displays them in separate sections based on the selected topic. It provides a centralized learning experience by pulling curated content from multiple platforms through keyword-based queries. In the future, ML can be integrated for semantic search to improve content relevance and personalize results based on user intent.
